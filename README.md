# Microsoft Movie Analysis
This is a project analyzing data on movies from the Microsoft company. The data was obtained from a dataset and consists of various features such as title, genre, budget, gross revenue, and more.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project is called "bom.movie_gross, "tmdb.movies", "tn.movie_budgets" and can be found on Box Office Mojo(https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), TheMovieDB(https://www.themoviedb.org/) and The Numbers(https://www.the-numbers.com/)

## Analysis
The analysis was performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. The following steps were taken to analyze the data:
1.	Data cleaning and preprocessing: the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any missing or incorrect values, and to convert data types as necessary.
2.	Exploratory data analysis: various features of the data were analyzed and visualized to understand their distribution and relationships with other features.
5.	Data visualization: the data was visualized using various plots and charts to communicate insights.

## Results
The analysis revealed several interesting findings, including:
1.	The most common movie genre in the dataset is "science-fiction", "Action", "superhero", and "family".
2.	The average budget of movies in the dataset is $17.5 million, and the average gross revenue is $68.4 million.
3.	There is a positive correlation between budget and gross revenue, indicating that higher budget movies tend to generate more revenue.
4.	Foreign movies tend to have higher gross revenue than domestic movies.
5.	The top 5 movies by gross revenue in the dataset are all foreign movies.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings of this analysis, we make the following recommendations to Microsoft:
Invest more in producing movies with high IMDb ratings: Our analysis shows that there is a strong positive correlation between IMDb ratings and domestic and worldwide gross earnings. Therefore, Microsoft can focus on producing high-quality movies that are likely to receive positive reviews from audiences.

Expand to international markets: Our analysis also shows that foreign gross can contribute significantly to a movie's overall earnings. Therefore, Microsoft can consider expanding its distribution and marketing efforts to international markets to tap into this potential revenue stream.

Diversify the movie genres produced: Our analysis shows that certain movie genres are more profitable than others. By diversifying the types of movies produced, Microsoft can reduce its risk exposure to fluctuations in demand for any particular genre and increase the likelihood of producing successful movies.

Overall, these recommendations are aimed at helping Microsoft maximize its profitability and competitiveness in the highly competitive movie industry.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the movie data, we can draw a few conclusions;
Firstly, the top 5 highest-grossing movies are all part of major franchises, indicating that established brands play a significant role in box office success.

Secondly, there is a correlation between budget and box office gross, but it is not a definitive one. There are cases where a movie with a lower budget has outperformed movies with higher budgets.

Thirdly, while the US is still the largest market for movies, there is a growing demand for movies in other countries, particularly in China. This is reflected in the higher foreign grosses for many of the movies in our dataset.

Lastly, the movie industry is a lucrative business, with some movies earning hundreds of millions, and in some cases, even billions of dollars. However, it is also a risky business, as demonstrated by the number of movies in our dataset that failed to make a profit.
